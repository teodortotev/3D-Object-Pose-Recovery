Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my project supervisor Prof. Victor A. Prisacariu for all his advice, guidance and support without which the completion of this project would not have been possible. I am extremely grateful that despite his busy daily routine, he managed to find time to explain difficult concepts, clarify different approaches and discuss my ideas on achieving the project goals. By allocating a spot for me in his own lab, he provided me with opportunities to improve my understanding of the field and increase my productivity.\\

Secondly, I would like to thank all graduate students in the Active Vision Lab at the University of Oxford for the knowledge and advice they shared with me when approaching various tasks during the project. Having walked the same path before, they provided me with indispensable information and allowed me to learn at a much faster pace. \\ 

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for their incessant support during the duration of my degree. Without their encouragement, understanding and advice I would not have been able overcome the obstacles encountered throughout my course.
